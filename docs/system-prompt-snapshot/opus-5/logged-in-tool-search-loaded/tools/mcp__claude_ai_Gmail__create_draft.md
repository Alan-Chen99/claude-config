## description

Creates a new draft email in the authenticated user's Gmail account.

This tool takes recipient addresses (`to`, `cc`, `bcc`), a `subject`, and body content as inputs. Plain text body content can be provided in `body` (do NOT format `body` with Markdown), and rich-text HTML content can be provided in `htmlBody` (use valid HTML tags for formatting; if both are provided, `body` serves as the plain-text alternative). If the draft is created as a reply to an existing message, the ID of the original message should be passed to the tool in the `replyToMessageId` field. Set `includeSignature` to true to append the user's configured Gmail web signature to the draft.

Returns a Draft object with the `id`, `threadId`, and `viewUrl` fields populated.
