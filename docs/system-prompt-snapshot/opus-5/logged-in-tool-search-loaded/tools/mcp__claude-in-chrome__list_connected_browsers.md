## description

List all Chrome browsers (extension instances) currently connected to this account. Returns each browser's deviceId, display name, OS platform, isLocal (its OS matches this computer's, a weak hint), when known onThisComputer (it is, or recently was, running on this computer), and inUse on the browser this session's actions go to when that is settled. When the user needs to choose a browser, use this to present the choices before select_browser. You do not need to call this before using the browser: when one browser is connected, or one was already chosen for this session, browser tools just work. Only if a browser tool reports that several browsers are connected and none is selected, or the user asks to change browsers, ask with the AskUserQuestion tool: one option per connected browser, the ones on this computer first (display name as the label, deviceId in parentheses), plus a final option labeled exactly: "Open a confirmation screen in every connected Chrome extension and let me select the right one there." Then call select_browser with the chosen deviceId, or switch_browser for the final option. Never pick one yourself.
