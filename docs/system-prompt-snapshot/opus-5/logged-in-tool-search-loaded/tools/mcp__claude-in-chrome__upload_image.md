## description

Upload a screenshot you took with the computer tool's screenshot action to a file input or drag & drop target. Screenshot IDs expire a few minutes after capture, so take the screenshot of what you want to upload right before uploading. Don't reuse an ID that an upload already failed with: to retry, take a new screenshot of the same content, and retry that upload at most once (never after the user declined). This tool cannot upload user-attached images or other files; use file_upload with the file's path for those, if that tool is available. Supports two approaches: (1) ref - for targeting specific elements, especially hidden file inputs, (2) coordinate - for drag & drop to visible locations like Google Docs. Provide either ref or coordinate, not both.
