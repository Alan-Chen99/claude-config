# mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp

## attributes

```json
{
  "eager_input_streaming": true,
  "defer_loading": true
}
```

## description

Creates a new empty tab in the MCP tab group. CRITICAL: You must get the context using tabs_context_mcp at least once before using other browser automation tools so you know what tabs exist. Tabs you create are yours to clean up: close each one with tabs_close_mcp as soon as you no longer need it, and close any that remain before finishing your task. Leave a tab open only if the user asked to see it or wants it kept open.

## input_schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {},
  "required": []
}
```
