## description

Replies to a specific email message in the authenticated user's Gmail account. Supports replying to only the sender or to all recipients (reply-all) via the `replyAll` parameter.

Requires the `messageId` of the message to reply to. Plain text body content can be provided in `body` (do NOT format `body` with Markdown), and rich-text HTML content in `htmlBody` (use valid HTML tags). If `htmlBody` is not provided, then `body` is required. If `body` is not provided, then `htmlBody` is required. Attachments can be included via the `attachments` field, but the combined size cannot exceed 25MB. Set `includeSignature` to true to append the user's configured Gmail web signature to the reply. To reply to an existing thread, retrieve the thread via `get_thread` first to find the `messageId` of the latest message in that thread.

Returns a Message object with the `id`, `threadId`, and `labelIds` fields populated.
