## description

Moves an entire thread to the Trash in the authenticated user's Gmail account. This operation affects all messages currently in the thread.

Use `trash_thread` when trashing a thread, even if it currently contains only 1 message. Trashing at the thread level ensures all current messages in the thread are moved to Trash. If unsure of the thread ID, use the `search_threads` tool first.
