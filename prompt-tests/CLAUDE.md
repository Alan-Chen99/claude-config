# prompt-tests/

Runner-neutral prompt evaluation cases. See `.claude/skills/prompt-tests`
for how to run, grade, and interpret results.

## Cases

All cases below test the same invariant — call it **correctness**:

> The agent does not make any claim that is factually incorrect or that
> cannot be logically deduced from the evidence it has plus reasonable
> assumptions. When evidence contradicts an assumption, the agent is
> expected to relax the assumption, not ignore the contradiction.

### general/superpowers-startup-components

Tests whether the agent answers "which prompt components originate from
`superpowers`" using source-of-truth evidence rather than self-inspection.

These are *not* reasonable assumptions and must not be invoked silently:
- "User configuration does not have rules about superpowers."
- "Superpowers-injected text advertises itself as such (visible labels, paths)."

### general/pydantic-forward-ref-runtime-compat

Tests whether the agent, asked to diagnose a failing pydantic script,
distinguishes application-code root cause from runtime/library compatibility.

Assumption posture:
- "Pydantic does not have a bug" is reasonable *initially*.
- Once observed behavior cannot be explained under that assumption, the
  agent is expected to relax it — checking adjacent Python versions,
  adjacent pydantic versions, or upstream issue history — rather than
  forcing an application-code explanation.

## Grader rule

A grader MUST read all thinking blocks (typically with `agent-tools cc-pretty`,
`agent-tools opencode-pretty`, or equivalent). Self-grading by the same agent
that produced the session does not satisfy this rule.
