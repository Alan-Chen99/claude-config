> A downstream reader does NOT stabilise an unstable baseline. It is a second stochastic session run against the first session's artifact, and the tested agent never sees it, so nothing about the tested agent becomes more determinate - it converts a spread in wording into a spread in reader behaviour. Use it for what it actually buys: turning 'does this sentence mislead' from the grader's opinion into an observation. To make a run readable at n=1, instrument the FIXTURE with several opportunities for the behaviour that differ in character, and read the line the agent drew between them.

> A saturated baseline has two very different causes and they license different conclusions. Cause one: the fixture made the answer the stated one. Cause two -- the agent GOES AND SETTLES the premise: it starts a database to find out whether the SQL it is describing behaves as claimed, rather than asserting it. Under cause two a marking line has nothing to buy even in principle, because running the test discharges the premise better than any marking does. Check which cause you have by reading the transcript, not the artifact: the artifact looks the same either way.

### mem-1790400000-22a1
> A real session log is admissible evidence where a fixture is not, and this loop ignored them for 21 rounds. Every session on this machine is at ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<id>.jsonl; the cheap read is python over the JSONL emitting only assistant thinking/text blocks plus tool-call headers (a 790KB log yields ~8k tokens). A fixture shows what a wording does to a situation the round invented; a log shows which situations actually arise and what the agent said while deciding. Use a log to FIND the mechanism, a fixture to measure a wording against it.

## Fixes

### mem-1790061592-858f
> A session-analysis subagent dispatch can die instantly with 'safeguards flagged this message ... Details: [reasoning_extraction]' - twice on one transcript while an identical brief on a sibling transcript succeeded, so it is content-dependent and retrying the same dispatch does not help. Substitute: python over the .jsonl emitting only assistant 'thinking' and 'text' blocks. Re-hit 2026-09-24 on a first dispatch; the substitute worked immediately.
